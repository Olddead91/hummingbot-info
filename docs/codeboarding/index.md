# CodeBoarding Documentation

Welcome to the CodeBoarding generated documentation section.

This documentation is automatically generated from repository analysis using CodeBoarding.

## What is CodeBoarding?

CodeBoarding is an AI-powered tool that analyzes codebases and generates comprehensive documentation automatically. It helps developers understand complex projects by providing:

- **Architecture Overview**: High-level understanding of the codebase structure
- **Component Documentation**: Detailed explanations of individual modules and classes
- **Flow Diagrams**: Visual representations of data and control flow
- **API Documentation**: Automatic generation of API references
- **Code Examples**: Practical usage examples and patterns

## How It Works

1. **Repository Analysis**: CodeBoarding scans the entire repository structure
2. **AI Processing**: Uses advanced language models to understand code relationships
3. **Documentation Generation**: Creates comprehensive markdown documentation
4. **Automatic Updates**: Keeps documentation in sync with code changes

## Available Documentation

The documentation files in this section are automatically generated and updated through our CI/CD pipeline. Each analysis provides insights into different aspects of the codebase.

## Integration with Hummingbot

This documentation is integrated into the Hummingbot website and follows the same structure and styling conventions. The generated documentation is automatically:

- Formatted for MkDocs compatibility
- Added to the site navigation
- Styled with the Hummingbot theme
- Searchable through the site search

## Manual Updates

To manually trigger a documentation update:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select **CodeBoarding Documentation Update**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Configure the parameters as needed
5. Review the generated pull request

The workflow will automatically create a pull request with the updated documentation.
