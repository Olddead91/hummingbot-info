## üîç How PMM Simple Differs From Other Strategies

**PMM Simple V2** is a foundational **market making strategy** implemented as a controller in Hummingbot V2. Its purpose is to continuously provide liquidity on both sides of the market and profit from capturing the **bid-ask spread** by placing symmetric buy and sell orders around the mid-price.  

Unlike more complex strategies in the Hummingbot V2 codebase, **PMM Simple** does **not use any technical indicators** or price forecasts. It places limit orders at fixed spreads around a reference price (typically the mid-price), aiming to consistently earn from spread capture. 

Strategies like `pmm_dynamic` adapt spread and pricing using MACD and volatility metrics (NATR), while `bollinger_v1` and `dman_v3` follow directional or mean-reversion logic with Bollinger Bands. PMM Simple stays always in the market, using clean, fixed parameters with minimal logic, making it ideal for stability, simplicity, and extensibility.


- **Compared with v2 simple_pmm script**

Both strategies place symmetric buy and sell orders around a reference price, but `simple_pmm` is a minimal script best for quick tests and basic setups. **PMM Simple V2**, as a controller, offers a more structured and maintainable design. Use `pmm_simple` if you plan to run your bot long-term, want better modularity, or intend to build on top of it in the future.

- **Compared with v1 Pure Market-Making**

V1 **Pure Market Making** is reliable and works well out-of-the-box, making it ideal for users who want a simple, ready-to-go strategy. However, its monolithic design makes it harder to modify if you want to add new features or customize behavior. **PMM Simple V2**, with its modular controller architecture, is much easier to extend and adapt‚Äîperfect for experimentation and long-term development.

## üß† How the Strategy Works

The PMM Simple V2 strategy places a symmetric grid of limit orders around the mid-price using your configured spreads. For example, a spread of `0.002` is interpreted as 0.2%. The total quote balance is automatically distributed across these levels‚Äîeither equally or according to your custom weightings (`buy_amounts_pct`, `sell_amounts_pct`).

Each filled order is handled by a `PositionExecutor`, which manages the exit using a **triple-barrier system**:

- **Stop-loss**: Protects against unfavorable price moves.

- **Take-profit**: Locks in gains once a target is hit.

- **Time-limit**: Closes stale positions after a defined period.

- *(Optional)* **Trailing stop**: Activates once a position is in profit and trails the price.

Behind the scenes, the controller monitors for stale or inactive orders and replaces them based on `executor_refresh_time`. If an order hits stop-loss, the strategy enforces a cooldown (`cooldown_time`) before placing it again.

### üîÅ How Rebalancing Works (Spot only)

If you're running the strategy on a spot connector and enable rebalancing, it will track your quote/base asset ratio. If the balance deviates beyond your `position_rebalance_threshold_pct`, the bot submits a market order to restore your original asset split. You can disable this behavior entirely by setting `skip_rebalance: true`.
