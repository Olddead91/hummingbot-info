## Release Highlights

### `conda` Environment Upgrade

The latest update upgrades Hummingbot's core environment to **Python 3.12**, bringing performance improvements and modern language features. The Anaconda/Miniconda environment has been streamlined to rely primarily on native `conda` packages, simplifying setup and maintenance. This upgrade makes Hummingbot faster and enables the use of modern Python libraries.

Key libraries, including **Pydantic** (now V2), have been updated to for better performance and compatibility. Additionally, test suites now utilize Python's **asyncio** framework, enhancing testing efficiency and reliability.

### PMM Controller and PositionsHeld

The latest release introduces a new feature in the Strategy V2 framework: **PositionsHeld**, which tracks a global set of spot balances and perpetual positions held by stopped Executors. `StopExecutorAction` can now be called with `keep_position=true` to maintain positions after stopping execution.

This new feature can be used by any strategy, and is ideal for market making strategies. It allows a strategy to track an inventory position that includes the amounts held for each asset and the unrealized P&L of each position, enabling more sophisticated strategies that skew prices and spreads based on inventory held.

This release also adds a new [**PMM Controller**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/pmm.py), a new strategy that leverages the `PositionsHeld` feature to provide a modernized V2 version of the [Pure Market Making](/strategies/pure-market-making/) V1 strategy.

### Gateway New vs Legacy

The 2.5 release introduces significant architectural changes to how the Hummingbot client interacts with Gateway, marking a major evolution in the platform's capabilities.

**New Gateway (v2.5)**

- Introduces new schemas: `Swap`, `AMM`, and `CLMM`
- Implements corresponding `GatewaySwap` class in the Hummingbot client
- Includes comprehensive test scripts for connector validation
- Planned for v2.6.0: Addition of `GatewayAMM` and `GatewayCLMM` classes
- Optimized for Solana DEX connectors and liquidity provision (LP) strategies

**Legacy Gateway (v2.2)**

- Maintains support for traditional `/price` and `/trade` endpoints
- Ensures backward compatibility with existing connectors
- Recommended for users who need to maintain compatibility with older integrations

For installation, refer to:

- [New Gateway](../gateway/installation.md) - For Solana DEX connectors and LP strategies
- Legacy Gateway - For compatibility with older connectors (see Gateway installation documentation)
