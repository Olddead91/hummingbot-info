## Exchange Types

Hummingbot supports three types of exchange connectors:

### CLOB CEX Connectors
CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) connectors integrate into centralized exchanges' WebSocket APIs, enabling standardized order placement/cancellation and order book data fetching from the perspective of Hummingbot strategies. These connectors work with traditional centralized exchanges that utilize a central limit order book model.

### CLOB DEX Connectors  
Decentralized exchanges that implement a central limit order book model on-chain, providing similar functionality to CEXs but with self-custody and on-chain settlement.

### Gateway DEX Connectors
Gateway connectors establish and maintain connections to automated market maker (AMM) DEXs and other protocols on various blockchain networks, interface with their JavaScript SDKs, and expose standard REST API endpoints for trading and liquidity provision-related actions on these DEXs.

See [CLOB Connectors](/connectors/clob/) for a list of the current CLOB connectors in Hummingbot and [Gateway Connectors](/gateway/connectors/) for a list of supported Gateway DEX connectors.

## Exchange Inclusion

Hummingbot [connectors](/connectors) link its internal trading engine to different cryptocurrency exchanges via WebSocket and/or REST API. They standardize interactions with the idiosyncratic APIs offered by these platforms, for purposes such as gathering order book and blockchain data, as well as sending and cancelling transactions and orders.

Since each exchange connector requires ongoing maintenance and may conflict with other connectors, the primary goal of the Hummingbot Foundation governance process is to let HBOT holders decide which exchanges are supported by the official Hummingbot codebase.

HBOT holders may propose to add new exchanges to the Hummingbot codebase via [New Connector Proposals](/governance/proposals), which require a pull request with the connector code to the Hummingbot Github repo, along with a minimum HBOT balance to create. For existing connectors, quarterly [Exchange Connector Polls](/governance/polls) determines which exchanges should be included in future releases and allocates HBOT bounties toward the supported exchanges.

## Exchange Sponsors

Exchanges may opt to sponsor the work of the not-for-profit Hummingbot Foundation. For these partners, we engage community developers to build and maintain high-quality, standardized connectors, ensuring reliable integration with Hummingbot's extensive strategy library. Our dedicated team provides oversight over the build process, continuous quality assurance, and assistance with the governance process.

Sponsors benefit from exposure to Hummingbot's active trader community through our documentation, announcements, and communication channels. For more information about sponsorship opportunities, please contact Foundation team members via Discord or email <contact@hummingbot.org>.

## How exchange partnerships work

When you sign up for an account using our referral links, a portion of your trading fees are rebated back to Hummingbot Foundation. Every time you use Hummingbot to submit an order, it sends an HTTP request to the API of the exchange. The exchange then identifies that the HTTP request for the order is coming from a user who is using the Hummingbot codebase, it checks for the metadata in the HTTP request for a Hummingbot identifier. If the identifier is present, the exchange knows that the order is coming from a Hummingbot user and will rebate a portion of the trading fees to us.
 
## Why should you support us?

These partnerships help sustain the Hummingbot Foundation's mission to keep our platform open source and free, while providing you with trading fee rebates at no additional cost. It's a win-win arrangement that supports both our users and the continued development of Hummingbot.
