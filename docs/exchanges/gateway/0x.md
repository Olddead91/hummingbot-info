## üîë How to Connect

Create a wallet on one of the supported networks below:

| Chain | Networks | 
| ----- | -------- |
| `ethereum` | `mainnet`, `arbitrum`, `optimism`, `base`, `polygon`, `avalanche`, `bsc`

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `gateway connect 0x` in order to connect your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want 0x to connect to? (ethereum) >>> 
Which network do you want 0x to connect to? (mainnet, arbitrum, optimism, base, polygon, avalanche, bsc) >>>
Enter your ethereum-mainnet private key >>>>
```

If connection is successful:
```
The 0x connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on ethereum-mainnet
```

## Configuration

Configure 0x settings in `/conf/connectors/0x.yml`:

```yaml
allowedSlippage: 1.0
gasLimitEstimate: 350000
ttl: 30
apiEndpoint: "https://api.0x.org"
apiKey: null  # Optional API key for higher rate limits
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **allowedSlippage**: Maximum acceptable price slippage percentage
- **gasLimitEstimate**: Estimated gas limit for transactions
- **ttl**: Time-to-live for quotes in seconds
- **apiEndpoint**: 0x API endpoint URL
- **apiKey**: Optional API key for enhanced features and higher rate limits

## üîÄ Router Connector
*Integration to 0x Protocol's professional-grade DEX aggregation*

- **ID**: `0x`
- **Connection Type**: REST via [Gateway](/gateway)
- **API Docs**: <https://0x.org/docs/api>
- **Folder**: <https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/tree/main/src/connectors/0x>
- **Default Configs**: <https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/blob/main/src/templates/0x.yml>

### Endpoints

- `/router/quote`
- `/router/trade`

### Features

- RFQ system for better prices from professional market makers

### How It Works

0x Protocol combines:
1. **On-chain liquidity**: Aggregates from Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and other DEXs
2. **Off-chain RFQ**: Professional market makers provide competitive quotes
3. **Smart routing**: Optimizes trade execution across all liquidity sources
4. **MEV protection**: Private pools shield trades from sandwich attacks
